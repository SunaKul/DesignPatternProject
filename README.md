Smart Study Planner is a console-based application. That is, no specific GUI requirements will be implemented. Moreover, no database management system will be used. The system is for university students to manage their study habits using study plans that a personal planner creates for them. Study plans have different study methods (Pomodoro and Deep Work), with different length variations (Short, Medium and Long).
